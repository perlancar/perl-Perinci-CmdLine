=head1 NOMENCLATURE

C<[PC::Classic]> denotes that the answer applies to L<Perinci::CmdLine::Classic>
only and not L<Perinci::CmdLine::Lite>. C<[PC::Lite]> denotes that the answer is
specific to Perinci::CmdLine::Lite. C<[PC::Any]> denotes that the answer is
specific to L<Perinci::CmdLine::Any>.


=head1 GENERAL

=head2 Why are there two frameworks Perinci::CmdLine::Classic and Perinci::CmdLine::Lite?

There used to be a single flavor Perinci::CmdLine. As it grows in features, the
startup overhead also grows. So another project is started,
L<Perinci::CmdLine::Lite> (hereby called PC::Lite) that focuses on keeping
startup overhead low to avoid making tab completion noticeably slow. It also
tries to reduce the number of dependencies. Later, the original Perinci::CmdLine
is renamed to L<Perinci::CmdLine::Classic> (hereby called PC::Classic). However,
some PC::Classic features are still missing in PC::Lite.

PC::Lite stays lightweight by avoiding the use of libraries that have large
dependencies or add too much to startup overhead. This includes replacing
L<Perinci::Access> with L<Perinci::Access::Lite> for metadata access, avoiding
L<Text::ANSITable> for formatting results, and replacing L<Log::Any::App> (which
uses the relatively heavy L<Log::Log4perl>) with L<Log::Any::Adapter::Screen>
for logging.

PC::Lite tries to start under 0.04-0.05s to make shell tab completion
convenient. On the other hand, PC::Classic application can spend between
0.20-0.50s before displaying output, due to various abovementioned overheads:
loading more libraries, etc.

Implementation-wise, the two share a lot of common code in the form of their
base class, L<Perinci::CmdLine::Base>. The interface is also 99% the same.

It is possible that in the future the two versions will merge again.

=head2 What Classic features are currently still missing in Lite?

=over

=item * More sophisticated formatting

Instead of L<Perinci::Result::Format> (especially for 'text*' formats which use
L<Data::Format::Pretty::Console> and L<Text::ANSITable>), to keep dependencies
minimal and formatting quick, PC::Lite uses the following simple rules that work
for a significant portion of common data structures:

1) if result is undef, print nothing.

2) if result is scalar, print it (with newline automatically added).

3) if result is an array of scalars (check at most 5 first rows), print it one
line for each element.

4) if result is a hash of scalars (check at most 5 keys), print a two column
table, first column is key and second column is value. Keys will be sorted.

5) if result is an array of hashes of scalars (check at most 5 elements), print
as table.

6) if result is an array of arrays of scalars (check at most 5 elements), print
as table.

7) otherwise print as JSON (after cleaning it with L<Data::Clean::JSON>).

YAML and the other formats are not supported.

Table is printed using the more lightweight and much faster
L<Text::Table::Tiny>.

PC::Classic supports more sophisticated formatting, can keep colored and
full-width Unicode characters stay aligned in a table.

=item * Support for extra protocols

Instead of L<Perinci::Access>, PC::Lite uses the more lightweight alternative
L<Perinci::Access::Lite> which does not support some URL schemes (riap+tcp,
riap+unix, riap+pipe). http/https and local are supported though.

=item * Extra stuffs that Perinci::Sub::Wrapper adds

PC::Classic uses function wrapper to automatically adds argument validation,
dependency checking, and so on. However, this adds too much overhead so PC:Lite
avoids it and do some of the stuffs by itself to avoid the overhead.

PC:Lite does argument validation, as well as dependency checking. But there are
other stuffs that Perinci::Sub::Wrapper adds that are not available, including:
result validation, validation of input stream (streaming argument) as well as
output stream (streaming result).

=item * Color themes

=item * Undo

=item * More advanced logging

Only logging to screen is currently supported by PC::Lite, using
L<Log::Any::Adapter::Screen>. PC::Classic, using L<Log::Any::App> can log to
files, directories, syslog, and other outputs.

=item * I18N

=item * The following environment variables

 PERINCI_CMDLINE_COLOR_THEME
 PERINCI_CMDLINE_SERVER
 COLOR
 UTF8

=head2 What is Perinci::CmdLine::Any then?

This is a module that allows you to select PC::Classic or PC::Lite. So your
scripts do not need to be modified when user wants to switch between the two.

=head2 How does Perinci::CmdLine compare with other CLI-app frameworks?

The main difference is that Perinci::CmdLine accesses your code through L<Riap>
protocol, not directly. This means that aside from local Perl code,
Perinci::CmdLine can also provide CLI for code in remote hosts/languages. For a
very rough demo, download and run this PHP Riap::TCP server
https://github.com/sharyanto/php-Phinci/blob/master/demo/phi-tcpserve-terbilang.php
on your system. After that, try running:

 % peri-run riap+tcp://localhost:9090/terbilang --help
 % peri-run riap+tcp://localhost:9090/terbilang 1234

Everything from help message, calling, argument checking, tab completion works
for remote code as well as local Perl code.

=head2 But my application is OO? But I want an OO framework?

This framework is currently function-centric. There are already several OO-based
command-line frameworks on CPAN.


=head1 DEBUGGING

=head2 How do I enable/view log messages?

The framework produces log messages using L<Log::Any>. You can display them on
the screen, e.g. using L<Log::Any::Adapter::Screen> like:

 % perl -MLog::Any::Adapter=Screen,min_level,trace /path/to/yourscript.pl

or:

 % TRACE=1 PERL5OPT=-MLog::Any::Adapter::Screen yourscript.pl

Log::Any::Adapter::Screen has a few other options and observes a few other
environment variables (e.g. for prefixing with timestamp, etc). See its
documentation for more details.

For sending logs to files, there are other Log::Any adapters you can look at.
Also take a look at L<Log::Any::App>.

=head2 How do I debug my CLI script?

To see stack trace on error, you can use L<Devel::Confess>.
Perinci::CmdLine::Base detects if Devel::Confess is loaded and will return the
stack trace for you:

 % perl -d:Confess /path/to/yourscript.pl

or:

 % PERL5OPT='-d:Confess' yourscript.pl
